# Security Guidelines for YouTube Downloader

## Credential Management

### GitHub Tokens
DO NOT store tokens in plain text or commit them to the repository. Instead:

1. Use Environment Variables:
   - Store tokens as environment variables
   - Access them through your application's configuration
   - Never commit actual token values

2. Token Security Best Practices:
   - Rotate tokens every 90 days
   - Use minimum required permissions
   - Never share tokens in plain text
   - Revoke compromised tokens immediately

### Secure Storage Setup

1. Create a `.env` file locally (already in .gitignore):
   ```
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

2. Access tokens in code:
   ```python
   import os
   github_token = os.environ.get('GITHUB_TOKEN')
   ```

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE
If you've accidentally committed a token:
1. Immediately revoke the token at https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Generate a new token with appropriate permissions
3. Update your local environment variables
4. Never commit the new token

## Credential Recovery System
1. Use a password manager for backup
2. Enable 2FA on your GitHub account
3. Store recovery codes securely
4. Document token generation process

## Date Management
- Token Creation Date: [Date]
- Next Rotation Due: [Date + 90 days]
- Last Security Audit: [Date]

Remember: Security is everyone's responsibility. Never share credentials in plain text or through unsecured channels.
